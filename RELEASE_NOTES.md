# Falcon Programmer Release Notes

## Version 1.0.1

### Enhancement

**MIDI for Macros page**: Added advice 'MIDI CC 38 does not work when assigned to a control on a script-based Info page'.

### Bug Fix

Fixed a bug where, when the **InitialiseLayout** task removed a GUI script processor, all other program-level event processors were removed too.
